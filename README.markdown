Sonia allows you to set up a dashboard with information that is important to you. Think [Panic's Status Board](http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/03/the-panic-status-board/).

At the moment, Sonia comes with [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/), [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com/), [Github](http://github.com/), [Icinga](http://www.icinga.org/), RSS, [TfL](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) and [Yahoo! Weather](http://weather.yahoo.com/) widgets.

Go ahead and have a look at [the demo](http://demo.soniaapp.com:8080/).

Thanks to Aaalex, you can watch a nice screencast introduction to Sonia at [RubyPulse](http://www.rubypulse.com/episode-0.38_sonia.html).

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
